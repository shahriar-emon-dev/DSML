In this description written by AI #DeepSeek,
Honestly, I am very passionate to learn Data Science and machine learning, I started the learning journey in May 2025. In Shah Allah, I will Learn, and I will be a Pro  DATA SCIENTIST
and also a Machine learning expert. 

I usually use AI for learning. I will create a coding problem using AI and then try to solve it. Sometimes, I can solve the problem, and sometimes, I cannot.
